## inspect Build Info

The files `inspect.js`, `inspect.wasm` are build artifacts generated by compiling [libaom 3.0.0](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/+/refs/tags/v3.0.0). Here are the instructions to compile libaom to generate the following files

### Build Instructions

Building the AV1 codec library with Emscripten is supported. Typically this is
used to hook into the AOMAnalyzer GUI application. These instructions focus on
using the inspector with AOMAnalyzer, but all tools can be built with
Emscripten.

It is assumed here that you have already downloaded and installed the EMSDK,
installed and activated at least one toolchain, and setup your environment
appropriately using the emsdk\_env script.

**Note: Make sure you use emscripten version before 1.38.41**

1. Clone the libaom repo

```
    $ git clone https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom
    # By default, the above command stores the source in the aom directory:
    $ cd aom
```

2. Configure the build:

~~~
    $ cmake /path/to/aom \
        -DENABLE_CCACHE=1 \
        -DAOM_TARGET_CPU=generic \
        -DENABLE_DOCS=0 \
        -DENABLE_TESTS=0 \
        -DCONFIG_ACCOUNTING=1 \
        -DCONFIG_INSPECTION=1 \
        -DCONFIG_MULTITHREAD=0 \
        -DCONFIG_RUNTIME_CPU_DETECT=0 \
        -DCONFIG_WEBM_IO=0 \
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/emscripten.cmake \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
~~~

1. Build it: run make if that's your generator of choice:

~~~
    $ make inspect
~~~

The outputs will be stored in /path/to/examples/inspect.*
